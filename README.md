This project was built as a personal learning exercise to understand how weather APIs work and how to fetch and display real-time data in a clean UI.  
I explored browser APIs like geolocation, worked with fetch() and async JavaScript, and improved the design through several iterations.

### ðŸŒ€ Why temperature may differ from Google

You might notice a slight difference between the temperature shown here and what you see on Google.  
Thatâ€™s because this app uses *OpenWeatherMap*, which updates its data every few minutes, while Google may use other sources that refresh more frequently or are more location-specific.

I've made sure to use proper units (metric) and also support coordinate-based search for better accuracy.
